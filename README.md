# Formula-e-Kodi-addon
Kodi addon that lets you access videos and live streamings from official [Formula-e webpage](http://www.fiaformulae.com). Events, insights, highlights and even live race video streams. It displays when and where is going to be the next race so to be able to use the live stream feature.

Currently it uses Youtube add-on to be able to watch videos from that source.
